# KDT Final Project

## Occasion

Cars are equipped with cameras. We want to build ADAS.
Use cameras on board to assist the human driver or to self-drive

## Goals

1. (Main) Detect where the free space is on the road _As Good As Tesla_
1. (Optional) Detect lane lines _As Good As Tesla_

## Obectives

1. Color the free space on the road by "**image segmentation techinque**"
1. Research state-of-the-art method to detect the free space on the road
1. Decide the proper image segmentation techinque for the project among many
1. Use dataset obtained from real car
